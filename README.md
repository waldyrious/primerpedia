Primerpedia is a proof-of-concept demo for the
[Concise Wikipedia](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Concise_Wikipedia) proposal.
It provides short summaries of Wikipedia articles,
for when you just need a quick overview at the topic.

<sup>(If that link is down, try [this one](https://tools-static.wmflabs.org/primerpedia)
or [this one](http://waldyrious.github.io/primerpedia).)</sup>

To achieve this, it uses the MediaWiki API to fetch the first section of an article,
and cleans it up for presentation, removing extra details and editing-related templates
(currently using the cleanup procedure implemented by the
[MobileFrontend extension](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:MobileFrontend#prop.3Dextracts)).

This tool should also help identify issues with the lead sections of Wikipedia articles,
which, according to the [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS:LEAD),
_"should define the topic and summarize the body of the article with appropriate weight."_
